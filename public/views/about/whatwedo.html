   <h3>What We Do</h3>
    <horiz-rule margintop='10' marginbottom="20"></horiz-rule>
  
   <p>School Arts Fund is a nonprofit organization founded to fund Performing and Visual Arts programs in Houston and surrounding areas public schools.</p>
   <p>The School Arts Fund has found a severe lack of funding of the Performing, Visual, and Industrial Arts in the schools. In some schools, there simply are no programs. In the schools where there are Arts programs, they are severely underfunded. Students and Teachers are often working without the essential supplies they need. Art classes without paper, and drawing instruments. Dance classes with barres falling off the wall, and floors with holes. Band Programs lacking the basic instruments they need, orchestras without enough music and music stands for all the members. Most schools do not even offer Industrial Arts programs any longer. Those schools that are lucky enough to have an Industrial Arts program, have equipment that is so outdated, it no longer applies in the real world. The School Arts Fund is a non-profit organization dedicated to changing this. We strive to do this through community involvement with local businesses, government, local artists, teachers, schools, and volunteers.</p>
